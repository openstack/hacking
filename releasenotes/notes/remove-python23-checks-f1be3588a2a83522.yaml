upgrade:
  - |
    The following checks have been removed:

    - H231 (incompatible ``except x,y:`` construct)
    - H232 (incompatible octal format)
    - H233 (incompatible use of ``print`` operator)
    - H234 (``assertEquals``/``assertNotEquals`` is deprecated)
    - H235 (``assert_`` is deprecated)
    - H236 (incompatible ``__metaclass__``)
    - H237 (removed module)
    - H238 (old style classes)

    These all checked for Python 3-incompatible code. They were disabled on
    Python 3 codebases and have therefore been no-ops for some time now.
